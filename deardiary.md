1. *Other cashback sites - what is a cashback site

I looked into what a cashback site is and I don't think it would mesh well with MyPackPacker, mostly because there is no product API. They are an affiliate program than gives the user a large portion of the affiliate share, so they certainly won't have an affiliate program of their own (if they did it would be like 1/8th of a percent or something).

It's a cool a concept that I would still like to show to my users, but I can't work it in right now.

Someone gave me a huge list of vendor recomendations, and also made a post with a ton of detail about them. I'll be able to add some of this info to the extra sourcing info when it comes out.
